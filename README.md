## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

I'm a junior software engineer with a background in Python and Django, currently focused on expanding my skills and understanding of modern web development practices. This space is a collection of personal projects, learning experiments, and small applications that reflect my growth as a developer and my curiosity to explore new technologies.

Django has been my starting point into backend web developmentâ€”its simplicity, built-in features, and clean design have helped me grasp the fundamentals of building robust web applications. From designing models and managing databases to implementing authentication and handling views, I enjoy working through the full cycle of building functional, data-driven applications.

As I continue to grow in this field, Iâ€™m also learning more about frontend technologies, RESTful API design, and best practices in code organization, testing, and deployment. I'm especially interested in improving the quality and maintainability of my code, writing reusable components, and following conventions that align with real-world software development.

This repository includes everything from small Django projects and Python scripts to more complete applications and notes on what Iâ€™ve learned. It serves not only as a portfolio but also as a journal of progressâ€”highlighting how I approach problems, apply solutions, and iterate on feedback.

Whether you're a fellow learner, a mentor, or just browsing, feel free to explore the projects, leave feedback, or reach out to collaborate. Iâ€™m always open to learning from others and contributing to meaningful work in the developer community.

Thanks for stopping by! I hope you find something useful, insightful, or inspiring within these projects as I continue to build and grow as a software engineer.
